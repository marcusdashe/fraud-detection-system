# Real-Time Fraud Detection System

## Setup:
- Compile and run Main.java using Java.
- No external dependencies are required.

## Algorithm Description:
- The algorithm processes a stream of transactions, identifying fraudulent patterns based on specified criteria.
- Efficiently handles large volumes of data without relying on external libraries for anomaly detection.
- Implements a mechanism to handle out-of-order events in a distributed system.

## Constraints Addressed:
- Written in Java.
- Efficiently handles large transaction volumes.
- Simulates real-time processing using an in-memory queue.

## Simulation:
1. Run the simulation script with the provided test dataset.
2. View the generated alerts and flagged users.

## Test Dataset:
